# Community Code of Conduct
Version 1.4
October 30, 2019

As members of the Eclipse community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting code reviews, pull requests, patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in the Eclipse community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, publishing others’ private information such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Eclipse Foundation staff have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Eclipse Management Organization: codeofconduct@eclipse.org.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html
